-- In this question, "for each" is the key phrase indicating you will need to use GROUP BY in the query.

-- We don't use GROUP BY here because that clause is typically used with aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, or COUNT. In this case, we need the highest salary and MAX is not an aggregate function.
-- MAX retrieves the maximum value in a column, it doesn't perform a calculation based on the total value of rows in the column, such as sum, average or total count.
-- You don't use MAX in the main select clause because you're trying to find the details (including salary) of the employee with the max salary in each department.
-- This means you first need to find the max salary per department with a subquery, then use WHERE to compare that to the salary of the employees in the main query.
-- The most you could do by combining MAX and GROUP BY is display the department and highest salary per department, you wouldn't be able to list other employee details.

-- We could only really use GROUP BY to do that if the question was only asking for the department and associated lowest salary.
-- Because the question asks for non-aggregated columns, we would need to use WHERE with a subquery query.
-- Here, the question just asks for the details of the overall lowest paid employee, so the subquery just needs to find the overall minimum salary.

-- "order_count" indicates we need to count the number of valid rows per customer in the orders table. "total_amount" indicates we need to sum order amount per customer.
-- Since this question is related to LEFT JOIN, it should have explicitly stated to include customers that haven't placed any orders.
-- Instead of using 'ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id', you could also use 'USING(customer_id)'.
-- We group by customer ID and customer name because it is best practice to GROUP BY all non-aggregated columns added to the SELECT Statement.
-- The solution joins customers, then orders, because you're much less likely to find orders without customers than you are customers without orders.

WHERE e1.manager_id IS NOT NULL; -- Solution
-- We need a self join here because a manager is an employee (the hierarchy). The manager_id column refers to a value from the employee_id column.
-- 'AND e1.employee_id < e2.employee_id' is required to avoid redundant pairs (i.e paring employee 101 and 103, then pairing employee 103 and 101)
  -- We use < (you can also use >) instead of != because != doesn't actually avoid redundant pairs. Two employees would never share the same ID because it's a primary key.
  -- Using < limits the scope of the comparison that the join performs. When comparing a row in table A to the rows in table B, it won't look at all of the rows.
  -- This results in pairs where e1.employee_id is ALWAYS less than e2.employee_id
-- 'WHERE e1.manager_id IS NOT NULL' is required to exclude employees who don't have managers.

  Question 20: UNION
