/*
  Question 1: DATA TYPES

  Calculate the number of days between each order_date and '2023-06-01' as "days_since_order". Also display the customer_id, customer_name, order_id and order_date for customers only who have placed orders.

/*
  Question 2: CONCAT

  Retrieve customer_name, customer_id and customer address as "full address" as a column using address and city combined one after the other.

  Question 3: CAST

  Calculate total amount for orders with order status = 'Completed' and cast as string with '$' prefix. Display column name as "total_amount_string".

  Table: orders

-- Previously thought that they weren't, but nested functions are allowed in SQL.
-- The final result we want is a composite string, so the outermost function should be CONCAT.
-- Next, we need to CAST the total order amount as a CHAR. To get the total, we use SUM within CAST.
-- When using CAST, the data type specified after AS and needs to be a supported SQL data type, not a custom value.


/*
  Question 4: LENGTH

  Retrieve order_id, order_date and order_amount along with customer_name and customer_id where customer name is of odd length for all customers who ordered.

  Table: customers
  ColumnName          Datatype

/*
  Question 6: CHARINDEX OR SUBSTRING_INDEX

  Exercise: Retrieve the customer_name along with their email as "EmailDomain".
  Note: You may use 'SUBSTRING_INDEX' here to solve the question which is MYSQL compatible.

SELECT
  customer_name,
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1) AS email_domain
FROM customers; -- Solution (CHARINDEX doesn't work in the code editor on the DEA website).
-- If CHARINDEX did work, we could have used SUBSTRING with CHARINDEX to get the email domain as follows:
-- SUBSTRING(email, CHARINDEX('@') + 1, LENGTH(email));


/*
  Question 7: TRIM

  Retrieve customer information including customer_id, customer_name as "FullName", trimming the address as TrimmedAddress and City.

  Table: customers
  ColumnName          Datatype           
  customer_id         int

  address           varchar
*/

SELECT
  customer_id,
  customer_name AS FullName,
  TRIM(address) AS TrimmedAddress,
  city
FROM customers; -- Correct!
-- 'TRIM(TRAILING ' ' FROM address) AS TrimmedAddress' also works. The question doesn't specify whether to trim leading, trailing or both.
-- TRIM(string) assumes you want to trim spaces from both ends of the string.


/*
  Question 8: LEFT & RIGHT

  Retrieve three letter short form of all departments starting from first letter as "ShortDeptName", alongside display employee_id and first_name & last_name combined as "FullName".

/*
  Question 9: UPPER & LOWER

  Retrieve product_id, converting product_name to uppercase as "ProductNameUpper", category to lowercase as "CategoryLower".

  Input Format: The products table with the following columns:
  ColumnName          DataType
  product_id          int

  o.order_status,
  c.customer_id,

-- We also could have extracted the numerical month from the order_date and used a CASE Statement to get the string month from that.
-- For example: CASE extracted_numerical_month WHEN 1 THEN 'January' END;
-- You could also use the MONTH function to get the numerical month from a date, instead of extract.


/*
  Question 11: COALESCE

  Find out all the employee_id, employee first_name as "employee_first_name", their manager first_name as "manager_name" and manager_id. Employees who do not have a manager or they are highest in hierarchy, assign 'Manager' as the columnar value for "manager_name" and "X" as 'manager_id'.

  Input Format: The employees table with the following columns:
  ColumnNames		DataType		
  employee_id		int		
  first_name		varchar

-- We join employees with managers (instead of managers with employees) because an employee is much less likely to have a manager than a manager to have no employees.

SELECT

-- This solution uses CTEs to perform the necessary calculations in stages.
-- In the first stage, employee count and average salary per department is calculated and saved in a CTE.
-- In the second stage, the overall average salary is calculated for all employees and saved in a CTE.
-- Lastly, we select the needed columns from each CTE and join the CTEs on the following condition: ds.average_salary > os.average_overall_salary;.
-- Joining on this condition ensures only records that meet the necessary criteria are returned.

-- This solution uses a CTE without utilizing window functions.
