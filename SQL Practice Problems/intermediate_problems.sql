  Problem 1: Employee Bonus Calculation

  Calculate and display 5% bonus amount for employees in the employee_dimension table who have generated more than $75000 in revenue. Round the employee bonus to 2 decimals.

FROM employee_dimension AS employee JOIN employee_performance_fact AS performance USING(Employee_ID)
WHERE revenue_generated > 75000; -- Correct!
-- Note: Question is not specific about which columns from the table should be included, but the employee_bonus column was correct when it was the only column I included.
-- Instead of joining, we also could have done:
select employee_id, salary, previousyearsalary, (salary * 0.05) as bonus
from employee_dimension
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM employee_performance_fact
    WHERE revenue_generated > 75000)
-- This might be better since joining wasn't necessary (we didn't need to include columns from both tables in the result set).
-- Consider using subqueries when joining isn't absolutely necessary.
-- We also could have added 'revenue_generated > 75000' condition to the ON Clause instead of putting it in a separate WHERE.

-- Even though the columns in the products and sales tables had different names, the productname and product columns were the common columns among the two.

-- This answer is correct. However, the solution only wants the result set to have customer name.
