-- In the subquery, we get the IDs for customers who have placed orders in at least two months of 2022 as follows:
-- We filter the result set with 'WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2022'
-- We GROUP BY customer_id, then filter those groups according to 'COUNT(DISTINCT MONTH(order_date)) = 2'
-- This ensures that the result set only includes groups where the distinct month count is at least 2.
-- Reasoning:
-- We need name from the customers_prc table and order information (orders made in each month of 2022) from the orders_prc table.
-- Instead of joining, we use a subquery.
-- In the main query we just need the names of customers who satisfy the requirements.
-- To get the requirements we filter costumer_id as follows in the subquery:
-- First, filter the orders_prc table down to 2022 orders.
-- Next group by customers.
-- Finally, filter those groups based on those that have a distinct month count of at least 2.

-- As in the posted solution, self join is an alternative approach to solving the problem.
-- The above solution involving window functions is not wrong, but may take longer to implement. It's also more complicated.
-- When using self join, each row in one table is compared to all rows in the other table.
-- To limit the results to positive date differences, WHERE is used.
-- Once the tables are joined and filtered as above, you can find the max date difference across all customers.
-- Joining that self join with the customers table allows you to get the customer's name.
-- In summary, in addition to analyzing hierarchical data, self joins can also be helpful when you need to make comparisons within the same table.
-- The grouping gets the longest gap per customer, then the order by and limit gets you the max among those customers.
