# Tips for Mastering SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language is what's used for querying databases and data stores in the field of data engineering.
- It is the number one data skill used in data engineering and data analysis.
- SQL proficiency will be assessed in almost every interview for a data-related role, with the exception of senior positions.
- Make sure to prioritize the lessons outlined in your personalized plan, don't go through all of the lessons on the DEA website.

Tips for Completing SQL Lessons:
- Watch the video, then read the question. Write the code that is needed to retrieve the data the question is asking for.
- Once the code is written, try to run the code to see if you got the question right. Always attempt to do the questions by yourself on the first try.
- When you get stuck on a question, don't dwell. Spend a decent amount of time trying to solve it, then look at the solution if you remain stuck.
- The lessons in your plan are only introductory. Completing them doesn't mean you've mastered the SQL skill in question.
- In addition to the lessons in your plan, it's also important to watch the full-length lessons on Skool. Also make sure to reach out on Slack and the weekly coaching sessions.
- When asking questions on Slack, make sure to take screenshots of the question your stuck on and give the full path the question on the DEA website, not just the link.
  - Also COPY THE CODE YOU TRIED TO WRITE THAT'S NOT WORKING so you and your coach can troubleshoot together.
- After completing the lessons, do the practice questions (the number of questions outlined in your plan).
  - Completing these practice questions is where you truly begin to gauge whether you've mastered a concept, take them seriously.
  - It's expected that you will need to refer back to the relevant lessons you've completed.
  - It's also expected to get stuck. Don't waste too much time getting stuck. Reach out on Slack and the coaching sessions.
  - Also, after looking at the solution, come back to the question 2 days later and attempt to do it again.
  - Also, always note down a detailed explanation as to why you got a question wrong or got stuck on a question.
- The goal of these practice questions is interview preparation. Make sure to only do what is outlined in your plan. Your coaches will let you know if you need more practice based on your performance during mock interviews.
- After completing the practice questions, you complete some actual interview questions from FAANG companies and other data engineering companies.
- After the practice interview questions, you'll complete a mini-mock interview with your success coach.

General Tips:
- Don't be deceived by the categorizations of beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The skill gap between beginner and intermediate is much wider than the skill gap between intermediate and advanced.
- With regard to the advanced SQL functions (Date, String, Window functions, etc.), you won't be penalized for not knowing the exact syntax during interviews.
  - The syntax for these types of functions varies for different "flavors" of SQL anyways.
  - As long as you generally know the type of function needed to solve the interview problem, you will be okay.
- For interview prep, also make sure to practice your timing and talking out load. LOOK INTO SPEECH THERAPY.
  - Don't focus on your speed until you've gone through the questions at least once though.
